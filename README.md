# Makromusic Relationships Structure Simulation

![Makromusic Relationships Structure Simulation](/img/makromusic_simulation.png)


## Introduction of Project 
The aim of this project is to simulate the relationship structure that exists in macromusic. In this simulation: 

- Accepting the Relationship
- Ignoring the Relationship
- Creating the Relationship

There are such cases. Our aim is to develop an application using the technologies and desired ones given in the ```Technology-Tool-Stack``` section below.

# Techstack of the Project

## Project Structure
User information and Users Auth information will be kept in SQL table. **REST Endpoints** will be as follows: 

- *Relationship Acceptance*
- *Relation Ignoring*
- *Relationship Creation*

We should have a *gRPC* module that outputs the relationship information. Generally the *REST API* will be calling **gRPC**. After making the necessary changes in the Database, **gRPC** will send the information ```("new_match","match_accepted","match_ignored")``` to the topics in **Kafka**. Consumers listening to Kafka topics will simply log this data.
**Auth must be done on the REST API side.** For this, as you remember, we created a Users Table. After the data is pulled from *PostgresSQL*, it should be cached in **REDIS**. There should also be a rate limit for each *ENDPOINT*, which must be handled with **Redis**.

In short: It should be a code that creates a relationship, and if certain users don't have a relationship or ignore it, they should call each other gRPC to create a relationship.
